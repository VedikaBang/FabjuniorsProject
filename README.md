# Fabjuniors Portfolio Project
*A responsive website for pune based kids' fitness start up.ðŸ¤¸* 

<s>**Rendering this website was quite a fun**</s>

## Highlights :

* #### *Meticulously created all the posters using*-, for tiles, [postermywall](postermywall.com ).
* #### combined Flexbox and CSS grids for extremely efficient layouts. 
* #### used [figma](https://www.figma.com/) for designing. 
    * ##### Figma is a web-based design tool with real-time collaboration. It's like Craft Freehand but with all the features of Sketch (and more). 
    * ##### Other than figma, Pen and Paper. (Quite efficacious to jot down client's requirements.)
* #### In terms of smiplicity, website is low-key inspired by [minimilastic website](https://thebestmotherfucking.website/).

*A touting feature: Since, I'm obssesed with color psychology, [must read](https://studywebdevelopment.com/understanding-color-web-design.html) selecting kids' pallet was bit a arduous process. Throwing Yellow in to make it ebullient didn't seem right.* *Startup is all about fitness, keeping that in mind chose colors which would convey optimism, enthusiasm, and passion.* *Javascript is [BFF](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Accessibility/CSS_and_JavaScript)*.
